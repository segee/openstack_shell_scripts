# Openstack_shell_scripts

To use these scripts, please first install the
python openstack client.
In ubuntu this can be done with:
sudo apt-get install python3-openstackclient

Next, the openstack rc file must be downloaded
this can be done by logging into the openstack
dashboard, setting the appropriate project as
the active project, selecting access & security
API access, and download openstack RC file
copy the file to the directory containing this 
script

Finally, create a text file named my_password
that contains your openstack password.  Use
chmod 000 mypassword
so the file is not readable by anyone.
